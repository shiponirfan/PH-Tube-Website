            Use Cases of Null and Undefined in JavaScript
          </h4>
          <h3 class="font-bold text-xl my-2">What is Null?</h3>
          <p>
            We have heard the word "null" many times in English. Its literal
            meaning is having no value. The same meaning is analogous to the
            meaning of null in programming. Null is basically an assignment
            value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as
            null contains no value. When we assign null as a value to any
            variable, it means that it is empty or blank. It is to show that the
            variable has no value. Also, null is an object in JavaScript. When
            it gets assigned to a variable, it represents no value. The setting
            of the value must be done manually by the user as JavaScript never
            sets the value as null. An object can be emptied by setting it to
            null.
          </p>
          <h3 class="font-bold text-xl my-2">What is Undefined?</h3>
          <p>
            There is a subtle difference between null and undefined, but as a
            programmer, it is important that we understand it clearly. As the
            name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we declare a
            variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable becomes
            undefined. Unlike null, the value of an undefined variable is set by
            JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets created at the run-time.
            When we do not pass an argument for a function parameter, the
            default value is taken as undefined. Besides, when a function
            doesn't return a value, it returns undefined.
          </p>
          <h3 class="font-bold text-xl my-2">Why is Null an Object?</h3>
          <p>
            Basically, null is a primitive type of a variable in JavaScript.
            Many people consider it a bug in JavaScript as it considers null as
            an object. Changing or fixing this bug will break the existing
            codebase, so it is not yet changed. The type of null is an object.
            That is why it is treated as an object. There is another theory
            behind this. The initial version of JavaScript had values stored as
            32 bits. The first 3 bits represented the data type, and the
            remaining bits represented the value. So for all the objects, the
            type started from 000. Null typically means empty, so it had all 0s
            stored in 32 bits. So the JavaScript reads the first 3 digits of
            null, which are all 0 and hence treats it as an object. The figure
            represents the same concept used in the initial version of
            JavaScript.
          </p>
          <h3 class="font-bold text-xl my-2">Differentiating Using isNaN()</h3>
          <p>
            The difference between null and undefined in JavaScript can also be
            made while performing arithmetic operations like- addition,
            subtraction, multiplication, division etc. While performing various
            arithmetic operations, null is converted to 0, and then the
            operation is performed, while undefined is converted to NaN. This is
            so because while performing arithmetic operations, the function
            toNumber() gets called on it, which converts null to 0 and undefined
            to NaN.

          <h4 class="font-bold text-2xl my-2">What do you mean by REST API?</h4>
          <p>
            An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that
            define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate
            with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design
            principles of the REST, or representational state transfer
            architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes
            referred to RESTful APIs. First defined in 2000 by computer
            scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, REST
            provides a relatively high level of flexibility and freedom for
            developers. This flexibility is just one reason why REST APIs have
            emerged as a common method for connecting components and
            applications in a microservices architecture.
          </p>
          <h4 class="font-bold text-2xl my-2">How REST APIs work</h4>
          <p>
            REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database
            functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records
            (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST API
            would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to
            create one, a PUT request to update a record, and a DELETE request
            to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A
            well-designed REST API is similar to a website running in a web
            browser with built-in HTTP functionality. The state of a resource at
            any particular instant, or timestamp, is known as the resource
            representation. This information can be delivered to a client in
            virtually any format including JavaScript Object Notation (JSON),
            HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is popular because it’s
            readable by both humans and machines—and it is programming
            language-agnostic. Request headers and parameters are also important
            in REST API calls because they include important identifier
            information such as metadata, authorizations, uniform resource
            identifiers (URIs), caching, cookies and more. Request headers and
            response headers, along with conventional HTTP status codes, are
            used within well-designed REST APIs.
